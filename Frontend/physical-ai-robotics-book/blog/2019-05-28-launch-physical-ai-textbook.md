### What’s inside
- **Module 1:** ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system—nodes, topics, services, URDF.
- **Module 2:** Digital twins with Gazebo physics and Unity visuals.
- **Module 3:** NVIDIA Isaac™ for VSLAM, Nav2, and sim-to-real export.
- **Module 4:** Vision-Language-Action capstone with Whisper + LLM planners.

### Why it matters
Embodied AI demands low-latency control, reliable sensing, and safe behaviors. This book is engineered for teams moving from cloud-only AI to humanoids that operate in the real world.

### Get started
- Read the **Introduction**: `/docs/introduction`
- Plan your **Hardware Setup**: `/docs/hardware-requirements`
- Preview the **Capstone**: `/docs/module4/week13-conversational-robotics`
